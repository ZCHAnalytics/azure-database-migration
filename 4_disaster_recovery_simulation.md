# Disaster Recovery Simulation

## Task 1: Mimic Data Loss in Production Environment
Deliberately remove critical data from the production database to replicate a scenario where data integrity is compromised. 

Ensure that you document this simulated data loss meticulously. This documentation will serve as a blueprint for the recovery testing.

After completing the simulation, confirm its success by examining the Azure SQL Database using the connection already established in Azure Data Studio.


## Task 2: Restore Database from Azure SQL Database Backup
