# Project: Azure Database MIgration
-  architect and implement a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure

Start: 
- establish a production environment database. 
- migrate the database to Azure SQL Database, focusing on crucial aspects to strengthen  data management approach like:
  -- data backup,
  -- restoration,
  -- automated scheduling. 
Simulation: a disaster recovery scenario with potential data loss. 
Geo-replication and failover configuration to ensure data availability even under challenging conditions.
Security: Microsoft Entra ID integration employed to define access roles, adding an extra layer of control and protection.

# Milestones 2: Set up production environment

## Set up a Windows Virtual Machine (VM)
The cornerstone of the production environment. This VM will emulate the functions of a Windows server, replicating the operations of an on-premise system within a company.
Throughout the course of this project, the VM will act as a repository for the company's database. This setup effectively simulates a secure and dedicated data storage solution.
### Ensure the appropriate network settings and firewall rules to establish a connection to the VM using the RDP protocol.
